                <p><b>WEB DESIGNING</b></p>
                <SMALL>I'm a first-year computer science student with a passion for web development. I'm proficient in HTML and CSS, the building blocks of creating visually appealing and interactive web pages. I'm also familiar with Git Bash, a version control system, and Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor, which helps me manage my code efficiently and collaborate effectively on projects.

                    I'm constantly eager to learn and expand my skillset in the exciting world of web development. I'm enthusiastic about applying my knowledge to create user-friendly and dynamic web experiences.
                    
                    Key Skills:

                    Visual Studio Code
                    Additional Information (Optional):To put my skills to the test, I recently built a functional clone of Amazon using just HTML and CSS!  This project allowed me to explore the fundamentals of web design and layout. I'm constantly learning and expanding my skillset, and I'm currently working on new projects to further my development expertise.

I have built a bus reservation system that Bus reservation systems are software solutions that streamline the ticketing process for both passengers and bus companies. Passengers can search for available seats, choose their preferences, and securely pay online, while bus companies manage routes, fares, and reservations all in one place. These systems offer real-time updates, convenience, and improved efficiency for all parties involved.
